Nevertheless, Rougly 20% respondents that provided comements feels that R&R is not relevnat to their research, there is no need for it or it is simply not suitable for some research designs.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Training on how to do this and what the different options are is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "> R&R is essential, but seems low on the list of many researchers' and institutions' priorities. There are still many analyses that lack a standardised, scientifically-verified best practice procedure, meaning that it can be difficult to even compare results from different field seasons.\\n\\nImproving the conditions of the laboratories (e.g. for the instruments to work more reliably) would help to flatten the baseline of analyses, making it easier to trust in technical replicates. It would also make it more logistically feasible to run multiple analyses and hence to verify conclusions through independent methods. Similarly, buying some communal field equipment (e.g. peristaltic pumps) would make it easier to increase sample size in the field, making it easier to trust in-field replicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Never thought about it in these terms before now and don't deem it of significance to what I research or teach. I can see how it might be relevant to some.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I would be very interested in attending R&R workshops. I don't have much experience of how things are done at Bristol, but I have benefited in the past from established data management infrastructure/staff. This has massively helped in collating and publishing data and the organisation of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Would be  good to have a training course. So far everything has been very learning by doing and trial and error with R&R.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I think it is great you are collecting responses on this! A seminar on R&R or perhaps a mini conference (say a half day with lots of short pop up talks and opportunity for breakout groups) on some good practices of R&R across the department would be helpful and inspiring i.e. how are we using github or data archives, who is good to talk to if I am interested in publishing my data? I don't think we place a lot of emphasis on it in the department currently so raising awareness would be a helpful first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I have to say it's the first I've come across the terminology. It seems important, even if greased towards more scientific modes of research. I think human geographers could have a fruitful discussion about what it means for them."
