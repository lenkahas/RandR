There are still many analyses that lack a standardised, scientifically-verified best practice procedure, meaning that it can be difficult to even compare results from different field seasons.

Improving the conditions of the laboratories (e.g. for the instruments to work more reliably) would help to flatten the baseline of analyses, making it easier to trust in technical replicates. It would also make it more logistically feasible to run multiple analyses and hence to verify conclusions through independent methods. Similarly, buying some communal field equipment (e.g. peristaltic pumps) would make it easier to increase sample size in the field, making it easier to trust in-field replicates."

Better training for PIs to ensure there is time throughout the project for appropriate coding practice and review, and training of research staff in formal software engineering to meet a basic standard are needed. There is no point in publishing code from a paper (e.g. on github) if it doesn't adequately explain how to use the code, dependancies, copyright and link to open-access data in exactly the right format."
